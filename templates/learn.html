      <h3>What is the Offside Rule even for?</h3>
      <p>If you’ve ever watched a football match, you’ve probably heard the term “offside” thrown around, often followed by some groans, cheers, or VAR jokes (a system that uses video footage to assist on-field referees in making decisions).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>In simple terms, the offside rule exists to prevent players from hanging around the opponent’s goal waiting for an easy chance to score. It keeps the game fair and strategic. It can get a bit technical, which is why even VAR (Video Assistant Referee) sometimes takes ages to decide.</p>
